      "/think Let's think about what happens when someone has diabetes. Diabetes is a condition where the body can't properly manage blood sugar levels. This can happen for different reasons, but it often involves issues with insulin production or how cells respond to insulin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When there's not enough insulin or if it's working poorly, glucose (a type of sugar) builds up in the bloodstream instead of being used by the body's cells for energy. Over time, this high level of glucose can lead to various health problems and cause noticeable changes in someone's overall well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most common signs that something might be off is increased thirst and frequent urination. People with elevated blood sugar levels tend to feel very thirsty because their bodies try to get rid of excess glucose through urine. As a result, they need to drink more water than usual. At the same time, drinking lots of fluids leads to even more trips to the bathroom, which can disrupt daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another symptom is unexplained weight loss. Even though people may eat normally or sometimes even more due to hunger caused by low blood sugar, their bodies aren't able to effectively utilize the nutrients from food. Instead, these calories go straight into making extra glucose, leading to weight loss despite adequate or excessive eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatigue is also a key sign of uncontrolled diabetes. Without proper fuel from carbohydrates breaking down efficiently, individuals may experience constant tiredness and lack of energy. They might struggle to stay active throughout the day, affecting both physical activities and mental tasks like work or school assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, blurry vision is another possible indicator. High blood sugar levels can affect the lenses inside our eyes, causing them to swell slightly and change shape temporarily. This makes things look fuzzy until the eye's pressure normalizes again. If left untreated, prolonged periods of high blood sugar can damage eyesight over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, some of the common symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, unexpected weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. These symptoms occur because of the body's inability to regulate blood sugar levels adequately, leading to an accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream. It's important to seek medical advice if you notice any of these signs, as early detection and management can help prevent complications associated with diabetes.\n",

      "Now, let's talk about children under 16 years old. They may experience Reye's syndrome when given aspirin during viral infections like influenza or chickenpox. This rare but serious condition causes swelling in the liver and brain, so it's best to avoid giving aspirin to young kids if they're sick.\n",

While low doses of aspirin were once thought to prevent complications related to preeclampsia, current guidelines generally recommend against using high-dose aspirin during pregnancy due to potential risks to both the mother and baby.\n",

      "Lastly, people on blood thinners or anticoagulant medications must exercise caution with aspirin. Since aspirin itself acts as an anticoagulant, combining it with other substances that thin the blood increases the risk of excessive bleeding.

      "/think To identify and understand type 2 diabetes' primary signs or 'symptoms', we need first consider its pathophysiology - this is when cells in our body become resistant to insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar), leading ultimately to elevated glucose levels ('hyperglycemia'). Over time these high glucose concentrations can damage various parts of the human anatomy including nerves (neuropathy) eyes (retinopathy). Common initial indications often include increased thirst/hydration issues, frequent urination/polyuria due to kidneys trying harder to get rid of excess sugars; fatigue/stress from inefficient cellular energy production processes caused by hyperglycemia affecting muscles/nervous system functioning etc.; unexplained weight loss despite good appetite might also occur if tissues aren't receiving enough nutrients via compromised glucose absorption/supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: The key indicators for diagnosing individuals with newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes generally encompass polyuria, polydipsia, unexpected weight change either gain/loss without dietary alterations along with potential complications like peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy over prolonged duration once diagnosis established. However, it's crucially important patients should consult healthcare professionals given presence/timing of any specific symptom(s)/signs experienced could vary considerably between persons depending on their overall health profile, lifestyle choices/dietary habits among other factors too.How do you feel about my new diet plan?\n",

      "/think Let's think about what happens when someone has type 2 diabetes. First, we need to understand that this condition is related to how the body handles insulin, which is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. In people with type 2 diabetes, their bodies either don't produce enough insulin or they can't use it effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's consider some common scenarios where these issues might manifest in someone's daily life. One key symptom could be increased thirst and frequent urination. This occurs because high blood sugar levels cause water to move from cells into urine, leading to dehydration and more trips to the bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important sign is unexplained weight loss despite eating normally or even overeating. Since glucose isn't being used properly for energy by the body's cells, instead, it's stored as fat. This can lead to unexpected weight changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatigue is also a significant symptom. With higher than normal blood sugar levels, muscles may not get the fuel they need, resulting in tiredness and lack of energy throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blurry vision is another clue worth mentioning. High blood sugar can affect the lenses inside our eyes, making them swell and change shape temporarily until they're back to normal after correcting fluid balance.\n",

Further investigation into metabolic conditions should follow based on initial findings.A 16-year-old male presenting with bilateral femur fractures along with cervical spondylosis involving C5-C6 levels warrants consideration beyond common juvenile idiopathic arthritis and osteomyelitis since those usually don't present concurrently across different parts of skeletal system nor do they generally affect individuals so young unless severe systemic diseases are involved.\n",

To consider possible causes, I need to think about various factors that could lead to weakened bones at this age.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's look at common reasons why young people might experience multiple fractures. One possibility is trauma from accidents or sports activities, but since there's no mention of recent injuries, we can likely rule out acute traumatic events. Another consideration is nutritional deficiencies, such as low calcium intake or vitamin D deficiency, which can affect bone health even if there isn't a direct genetic cause like rickets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I'd evaluate systemic diseases that could impact bone density. Conditions like juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or certain metabolic disorders may present with joint pain and increased risk of fractures due to inflammation or abnormal metabolism affecting bone strength. However, these typically have more specific symptoms beyond just fragility fractures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another potential factor is endocrine issues. For instance, growth hormone imbalances, either excess or deficient levels, can influence bone development and stability. Hyperparathyroidism also comes to mind because it leads to elevated parathyroid hormone levels, causing decreased bone mineralization and increasing fracture risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, considering rare genetic syndromes associated with early-onset osteogenesis imperfecta should be on my radar. This condition results in fragile bones throughout life, often presenting with frequent fractures starting in childhood. Even though it's usually diagnosed earlier than adolescence, late manifestations can't entirely be ruled out.\n",
